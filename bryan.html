 </h1>
 <h1>Next, take a shovel and bring the sandwich to a empty indoor parking lot with no one around. Next, use your shovel to smash it in the ground very hard <u><i>69 times</i></u>.</h1>

 <h1> Now this next step is super super super super super super super super super super super super super important</h1>
 <p><b>Get your sandwich, and then add 100liters of hot sauce, mayo, ketchup, mustard,milk, water.Once you have completed that step, drink all of it and add 100 liters of the same thing again.</p>

 <h1> 2nd Final Step</h1>
 <p>Put it in the micro wave, and set the degree to 350 C for one minute.<b>Oh wait, YOU DON'T HAVE ONE, imagine not having a microwave.</b> It is ok though, since you have a convenient flamethrower.
Turn it on for 69 minutes that that have smooth and fresh smell. </p>

<h1> Final Step
</h1>
<p>Now all we need to do is just add some topping. I recommend crickets because of how disgusting you are.</p>

Add 69 crickets to your sandwich at <u>cricketstore.com</u>
Enjoy it with your friends and family! Bye!
